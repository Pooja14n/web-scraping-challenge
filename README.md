# web-scraping-challenge

# Requirements
This challenge consists of two technical products; and, the following deliverables have to be submitted:
1. Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
2. Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

# Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
In the Jupyter Notebook, the following steps are to be followed to scrape the Mars News website.

1. Use automated browsing to visit the `Mars news site` (https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html). Inspect the page to identify which elements to scrape.
2. Create a Beautiful Soup object and use it to extract text elements from the website.
3. Extract the titles and preview text of the news articles that you scraped. Store the scraping results in Python data structures as follows:
  a. Store each title-and-preview pair in a Python dictionary and, give each dictionary two keys: title and preview. 
  b. Store all the dictionaries in a Python list.
  c. Print the list in the notebook.
